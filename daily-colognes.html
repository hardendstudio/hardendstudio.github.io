<h2>1. Calvin Klein CK One</h2>

 Great for everyday confidence without intensity.

<h2>2. Guess Seductive Homme Blue</h2>
<p>
Balanced between fresh and subtle woody warmth, Guess Seductive Homme Blue opens with citrus and aquatic notes, then settles into a soft spicy-woody heart. It’s not overly bold, but still has character — perfect if you want something everyday appropriate with a bit of charm.
 Great choice for school, work, casual dates, and daily outings.
